List of tools used
1. rmneshta.exe from AVG
2. Medicat (absolute unit of a tool)
   - Mini Windows 10 with Jayros Lockpick
   - Symantec Ghost for cloning
   - Mini Malwarebytes LiveCD where I ran rmneshta.exe (yes I ran a AV tool inside of a bootable AV tool, sue me lol)
3. Orico NVME to USB C adapter (for the clone)
4. 1tb kingston nvme nothing special
5. Ifixitkit + LTT screwdriver (wierd flex I know)
6. Can I call neshta a tool? I used Neshta.Virus's own restore point before it nuked the customers machine.
7. autoruns
8. AVG
9. I had chatgpt make me a bash script to sanitize the usbs on a baremetal ubuntu machine before I plugged them into my host. (I honestly have no idea if it even worked but my host and cx machine is not infected so thats a good sign)
   **** I am by no means a professional (yet) and I am well aware that if I didn't find that restore point I and CX probably would be SOL. ***
